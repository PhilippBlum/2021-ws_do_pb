---

# Reasons to transform 
* Communication problems
* Poor flexibility
* Long decision-making path
* Companies have a hard time innovating
* Ignoring change leads often to interruption

# Why were Ambidextrous Organizations developed?

- ***Exploration*** and ***Exploitation*** were researched extensively and it was found out that these two ideas could not coexist in an organization for various reasons (competition for resources and so on...). 
- Therefore multiple frameworks were build to make that possible.
>> &rarr; one of those frameworks is an "***Ambidextrous Organization***"

## Exploitation and Exploration 
#### Exploitation: 
It refers to constantly exploiting the available resources and ideas and making improvements wherever necessary. 
>> &rarr; Ressources, process, units, structure, teams, etc.
#### Exploration: 
Constantly innovating and exploring new ideas and opportunities. 
 >> &rarr; Innovations, optimization, improvements through change management

## Summary
To quickly sum up, what our research found out.
1. The essence of exploitation is the refinement and extension of existing competencies, technologies, and paradigms.
2. Exploration tries to  shift to a new technology which means finding a new trajectory. They do that by planned experimentation and play.
3. The essence of exploration is experimentation with new alternatives to come up with new ideas.

# Ambidextrous Organizations

Be efficient in todays management and also be able to adapt tomorrows changes. //Link einbinden!!!

1. centralized vs decentralized
2. tight, strict culture vs loose culture
3. Maximize efficiency vs frequent experiments

# Main takeaways

1. To stay relevant you have to constantly innovate. 
2. Approaches to that are exploration and exploitation. 
3. The framework that makes both of those concepts possible is ambidextrous organization.
4. Ambidextrous organization is a way to capture the challenge in businesses being able to make steady improvements to existing models whilst still developing breakthrough innovations.
