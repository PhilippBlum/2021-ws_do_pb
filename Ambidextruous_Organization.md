# Ambidextrous Organziation
---

Background
•Sustainable strategy
•Continues learning

---
# Meaning:
• The Roman god Janus had two sets of eyes—one pair focusing on what lay behind, the other on what lay ahead. 

• “Ambidexterity” can be defined as a state of being equally adapted in the use of both the left and the right hand, and also in using them at the same time. 

---
# Ambidextrous Organization 
• Many successful companies separate new exploratory units from exploitive traditional units, but still keep a tightly linked executive team to manage the organizational separation. 

• Such companies are referred to as “ambidextrous organizations”. 

• Managers in an ambidextrous organization are expected to be able to explore new opportunities while also making steady improvements to what already exists. 

• A clear vision is crucial in transforming a company into an ambidextrous organization. 

---
# Reasons to transform into an ambidextrous organization
• Big and old companies have a hard time innovating
• The companies must be aware of the situation and see the signals
• Often its risky to keep the old structure of the company and not changing current paths
• Ignoring the signals leads often to interruption

- Restructuring the organization and splitting teams and creating new teams makes it possible to react to the environmental change.
- Its important that every instance is ready and open-minded for the new
- The organization must focus on exploration and exploitation equally

---

# Exploitation and Exploration 

• Exploitation: It refers to constantly exploiting the available resources and ideas and making improvements wherever necessary. 


• Exploration: Constantly innovating and exploring new ideas and opportunities. 
Exploration includes things captured by terms such as search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation

organic structures, loosely coupled systems, path breaking, improvisation, autonomy and chaos, and emerging markets and technologies

---

# Results of exploitation 
•	Organizations that engage in exploitation mine depths of their core strengths and make the most of the resources available with them. 
•	They focus on efficiency and productivity by capitalizing on their core strengths and differentiators. 
•	It results in 
1.	Avoidance of conflict 
2.	Reduction of change 
3.	Retaining and protecting identity. 

Example: Building new teams with focusing on specific skills from old ones so reusing or using the resources differently than before. 
Teams who are working together for several years have adapted the behavior, thinking and vision of the other team members. Switching up the teams and recreating on a different type of focus it could help to reactivate those resources for the better.

---

# Results of Exploration 
•	Organizations that focus on exploration fix their gaze upon the horizon. 
•	They discover new resources and find new ways to do things. 
•	Here the focus in on Innovation. 
•	It results in 

1.	Discovering new products, markets 
2.	Embracing conflicts and using it positively 
3.	Accepting and adapting to change 
4.	Considering new identities 

Example: Big companies build a team or new instance which is focusing on the exploration part. For example, like the bmw startup garage

Exploration refers to learning gained through processes of concerted variation, planned experimentation, and play”
Exploitation refers to learning gained via local search, experiential refinement, and selection and reuse of existing routines.
Exploitative innovations involve improvements in existing components and build on the existing technological trajectory.
Exploratory innovation involves a shift to a different technological trajectory

---

## Summary
To quickly sum up, what our research found out.
1. The essence of exploitation is the refinement and extension of existing competencies, technologies, and paradigms.
2. Exploration tries to  shift to a new technology which means finding a new trajectory. They do that by planned experimentation and play.
3. The essence of exploration is experimentation with new alternatives to come up with new ideas.

---

## Why were Ambidextrous Organizations developed?

- Exploration and Exploitation were researched extensively and it was found out that these two ideas could not coexist in an organization for various reasons (competition for resources and so on...). 
- Therefore multiple frameworks were build to make that possible.
- And one of those frameworks is an ambidextrous organization.

---

## Innovation
To be sustainably successful in the long run, companies have to maintain a variety of innovation efforts. Companies must constantly pursue innovation, but at the same time they have to make architectural innovations and radical innovations. Ergo, the company must have an ambidextrous organization for them to be able to fulfill all of this. an ambidextrous organization is capable of simultaneously exploiting existing competencies and exploring new opportunities. There are two ways of organizational ambidexterity can be used; Structural ambidexterity which means that exploration and exploitation are undertaken in separate organizational units or Contextual ambidexterity which involves the same organizational units and the same organizational members pursuing both exploratory and exploitative activities . 

---

# Ambidextrous Organizations
Ambidextrous organization designs are composed of highly differentiated but weakly integrated subunits. While the exploratory units are small and decentralized, with loose cultures and processes the exploitation units are larger and more centralized, with tight cultures and processes. Exploratory units succeed by experimenting by frequently creating small wins and losses, Because process management tends to drive out experimentation, it must be prevented from migrating into exploratory units and processes In contrast, exploitation units that succeed by reducing variability and maximizing efficiency and control are an ideal location for tight coordination associated with process management efforts.

---

# What is Ambidexterity
Ambidexterity refers to the synchronous pursuit of both exploration and exploitation via loosely coupled and differentiated subunits or individuals, each of which specializes in either exploration or exploitation.

Story of a Someone who founded a company and he had a hard time during corona. 
He read a paper on ambidextrous organization which says: "Ambidextrous organizations are able to manage organizational paradoxes and simultaneously achieve aims which seem divergent or even  contradictory such as e.g.: short-term survival and long-term growth, incremental and radical innovations or competition vs cooperation etc. Ambidexterity is achieved by balancing exploration (search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery or innovation) with exploitation (refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, and execution)". And now he thinks to himself. Ok to try to stay relevant, I have to innovate constantly and not end up like kodak. To do that, he establishes two different units in his company. One who is exploring and one who is exploiting. One who is responsible for short-term survival and the other one for long term growth.
The exploitation unit responsible for short term survival begins their work. They analyse their own company and come up with a plan to cut costs and plan out their current product portfolio. What products don't sell and which do? The ones that don't sell are thrown out of their portfolio. After a few months their revenue stayed the same but they reduced their operating cost by 50%, short term survival was guaranteed. Meanwhile the exploration unit was busy inventing new products and luckily they found a way to clone people. Now long-term growth can be guaranteed.
After only a few months someone was able to completely restructure the company by using the ambidextrous organization approach.

1. To stay relevant you have to constantly innovate. 
2. Approaches to that are exploration and exploitation. 
3. The framework that makes both of those concepts possible is ambidextrous organization.

THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN EXPLORATION AND
EXPLOITATION

Exploration and exploitation have emerged as the twin concepts underpinning organizational
adaptation research, yet some central issues related to them remain ambiguous.
We address four related questions here: What do exploration and exploitation
mean? Are they two ends of a continuum or orthogonal to each other? How should
organizations achieve balance between exploration and exploitation—via ambidexterity
or punctuated equilibrium? Finally, must all organizations strive for a balance, or
is specialization in exploitation or exploration sometimes sufficient for long-run success?
We summarize the contributions of the work in this special research forum and
highlight important directions for future research.
Since the publication of March’s (1991) pioneering
article, the terms “exploration” and “exploitation”
have increasingly come to dominate organizational
analyses of technological innovation,
organization design, organizational adaptation, organizational
learning, competitive advantage and,
indeed, organizational survival (e.g., Benner &
Tushman, 2003; Burgelman, 2002; Holmqvist,
2004; Katila & Ahuja, 2002; Lee, Lee, & Lee, 2003;
McGrath, 2001; Sigglekow & Levinthal, 2003). Notwithstanding
the growing reliance of organizational
research on these twin concepts, an examination
of the literature indicates that the answers contained
there to the central questions on this subject
remain incomplete, at times contradictory, and at
best ambiguous. We use the term “central questions”
to refer to the following four issues.
The first issue pertains to definitions and connotations.
What do exploration and exploitation really
mean? There appears to be consensus around
the view that exploration refers to learning and
innovation (i.e., the pursuit and acquisition of new
knowledge). However, a similar consensus is lacking
on the question of whether exploitation refers
solely to the use of past knowledge or whether it
also refers to the pursuit and acquisition of new
knowledge, albeit of a kind different from that associated
with exploration. For scholars to build a
truly informative and significant body of research
in this area, it is critical that they be clear on definitional
issues. Also, it is important to ensure that
the way exploration and exploitation are empirically
defined is consistent with and appropriate to
their conceptual definitions.
The second issue pertains to orthogonality versus
continuity. Are exploration and exploitation two
ends of a continuum, or two different and orthogonal
aspects of organizational behavior? In part, the
answer to this question depends on the conceptual
definition of the terms “exploration” and “exploitation.”
However, the salience of this question goes
far beyond mere definitions. Theories about the
ease or difficulty with which an organization can
pursue both exploration and exploitation depend
crucially on whether these two tasks are treated as
competing or complementary aspects of organizational
decisions and actions. In addition to theory
development, empirical tests of predictions regarding
the impact of “balance” between exploration
and exploitation on organizational performance
would need to be different depending on whether
these two concepts are viewed as mutually antithetical
or complementary.
The third issue pertains to ambidexterity versus
punctuated equilibrium. Building on March’s initial
premise that organizational “adaptation requires
both exploitation and exploration to achieve
persistent success” (1991: 205), some studies have
concluded that the answer lies in “ambidexterity”
(Benner & Tushman, 2003), whereas others have
concluded that the answer lies in “punctuated
equilibrium” (Burgelman, 2002). Ambidexterity refers
to the synchronous pursuit of both exploration
and exploitation via loosely coupled and differentiated
subunits or individuals, each of which specializes
in either exploration or exploitation. In
contrast, punctuated equilibrium refers to temporal
rather than organizational differentiation and sug-

gests that cycling through periods of exploration
and exploitation is a more viable approach than a
simultaneous pursuit of the two. As may be clear,
ambidexterity and punctuated equilibrium are
radically different mechanisms. Existing literature
is silent on the questions of whether these
two mechanisms are equally viable, so that an
organization can pick one or the other at will, and
whether exogenous or endogenous contextual
factors should drive the choice between the two
mechanisms.
Finally, the fourth issue pertains to duality versus
specialization. Echoing March’s (1991) arguments
about the need for balance between exploration
and exploitation, there is near consensus in the
literature that, notwithstanding their radically different
dynamics, organizations must learn to excel
at both tasks. We wonder, however, if such a consensus
may be somewhat premature and not necessarily
logical in all contexts.
In the balance of this paper, we address each of
these four issues and then provide an overview of
the seven papers that comprise this special research
forum on managing exploration and exploitation.
Finally, we offer a set of research questions
and research questions to guide future research.
DEFINITIONS AND CONNOTATIONS
As noted, the central ambiguity regarding the
definition and implications of exploration and exploitation
lies in whether the two are distinguished
by differences in the type of learning or by the
presence versus the absence of learning. Baum, Li,
and Usher (2000), Benner and Tushman (2002), and
He and Wong (2004) are illustrative of studies that
explicitly embrace the idea that both exploration
and exploitation are associated with learning and
innovation, albeit of different types. Baum, Li, and
Usher suggested that “exploitation refers to learning
gained via local search, experiential refinement,
and selection and reuse of existing routines.
Exploration refers to learning gained through processes
of concerted variation, planned experimentation,
and play” (2000: 768). According to Benner
and Tushman, “Exploitative innovations involve
improvements in existing components and build
on the existing technological trajectory, whereas
exploratory innovation involves a shift to a different
technological trajectory” (2002: 679). Along the
same lines, He and Wong (2004: 483) defined exploitative
innovation as “technological innovation
activities aimed at improving existing product-market
domains” and exploratory innovation as “technological
innovation aimed at entering new product-
market domains.” As is evident, in all of these
studies, learning, improvement, and acquisition of
new knowledge are central to both exploitation and
exploration. At the same time, the differences between
the two concepts pertain to whether the new
learning occurs along the same trajectory as the old
one or along an entirely different trajectory.
In contrast, other studies (e.g., Rosenkopf &
Nerkar, 2001; Vassolo, Anand, & Folta, 2004; Vermeulen
& Barkema, 2001) appear to treat all activities
associated with learning and innovation as
instances of exploration and to reserve the term
“exploitation” for activities in which the central
goal is using past knowledge rather than moving
down any kind of a learning trajectory. This approach
to conceptual interpretation appears explicit
in Rosenkopf and Nerkar’s (2001) study of the
impact of local and nonlocal knowledge search on
the quality of resulting patents. In the case of patents
that were informed exclusively or largely by
local knowledge, they accepted the possibility that
“some readers might consider this a form of exploitation
rather than local exploration” (2001: 289).
However, noting that their study focused entirely
on the R&D process and patenting activity, they
preferred to term such cases “the most localized
form of exploration” rather than “exploitation.”
Similarly, in their study of firms’ international expansion
decisions, Vermeulen and Barkema (2001:
459) defined exploration as the “search for new
knowledge” and exploitation as the “ongoing use of
a firm’s knowledge base.” Building on these definitions,
they treated all acquisitions as representing
exploration and all greenfield investments as representing
exploitation.
Reflecting on these somewhat different approaches
to defining exploration and exploitation,
our conclusion is to build on March’s (1991) logic
and to argue that all activity includes at least some
learning. Even when an organization is attempting
to do nothing more than replicate past actions, it
accumulates experience and goes down the learning
curve, albeit in an incremental manner (Yelle,
1979). Thus, for social systems, there is no such
thing as perfect replication. There is always some
learning, even if it is relatively little and serves
only to reduce variation around the historical
mean. As March noted, “The essence of exploitation
is the refinement and extension of existing
competencies, technologies, and paradigms. . . . The
essence of exploration is experimentation with new
alternatives” (1991: 85). To sum up, we would argue
that it is more logical to differentiate between
exploration and exploitation by focusing on the
type or amount of learning rather than on the presence
or absence of learning. Defining these concepts
in terms of the presence or absence runs at
694 Academy of Management Journal August
least two kind of risks. One, many activities that, by
March’s (1991) definition, should be viewed as exploitative
would instead be counted and coded as
exploratory. Two, for activities coded as exploitative,
researchers may overlook the reliability-enhancing
learning that results from all human and
organizational attempts to replicate past routines.
In keeping with March (1991), in this discussion
of what exploration and exploitation mean, we
have treated the organization as the unit of analysis.
However, variations in the unit of analysis may
well affect the answer to our questions, What is
exploration and What is exploitation? That is,
whether learning differs by type or by presence
versus absence could very well depend on whether
one is focused on the individual level, the team
level, or a more macro organization level. For example,
an engineer might search and experiment to
discover a new method of producing a product, but
the organization in which he/she is employed
might then exploit this new innovation for profit.
Similarly, it is entirely possible that repetitious
routines of exploitation may not involve much
learning at the individual level (e.g., a machine
operator producing the same widget each day).
However, such an absence of learning is less likely
at the group or organizational level simply because
of variation in skills, knowledge, and experience
across individuals. In other words, at a group or
more macro level, it is more likely that some learning
from experience will take place because of differences
among individuals. Consequently, what
one individual or organization may view as exploratory
and experimental learning, another team or
individual may view as exploitative or incremental
learning. The above discussion highlights the need
for researchers to carefully specify a unit of analysis
in defining exploration and exploitation.
CONTINUITY VERSUS ORTHOGONALITY
March (1991) appeared very clear in his theorization
that, even though both exploration and exploitation
are essential for long-run adaptation, the
two are fundamentally incompatible. March (1991,
1996, 2006) provided several arguments in favor of
this incompatibility. First, exploration and exploitation
compete for scarce organizational resources.
Thus, by definition, more resources devoted to exploitation
imply fewer resources left over for exploration,
and vice versa. Second, and assuming all
else equal, both types of actions are iteratively selfreinforcing.
Because of the broad dispersion in the
range of possible outcomes, exploration often leads
to failure, which in turn promotes the search for
even newer ideas and thus more exploration,
thereby creating a “failure trap.” In contrast, exploitation
often leads to early success, which in turn
reinforces further exploitation along the same trajectory,
thereby creating a “success trap.” In short,
exploration often leads to more exploration, and
exploitation to more exploitation. Third, the mindsets
and organizational routines needed for exploration
are radically different from those needed for
exploitation, making the simultaneous pursuit of
both all but impossible. As March noted, “Exploiting
interesting ideas often thrives on commitment
more than thoughtfulness, narrowness more than
breadth, cohesiveness more than openness” (1996:
280). To summarize March’s arguments, notwithstanding
the adaptation benefits of both exploration
and exploitation, the interplay between the
two occurs in the form of a zero-sum game where
exploration and exploitation compete for scarce resources,
attention, and organizational routines; accordingly,
logic dictates that exploration and exploitation
be viewed as two ends of a continuum.
It is all but impossible to dispute March’s logic.
However, it is possible to question some of his key
assumptions. Consider his arguments about the scarcity
of resources. Although it is generally true that
most organizational resources are finite, this need not
be so for all types of resources. Some resources, such
as information and knowledge, may be infinite (Shapiro
& Varian, 1998). Also, organizations often have
access not only to the resources that they own but
also to resources in their external environments
(Powell, Koput, & Smith-Doerr, 1996). Access to such
external resources may come about either because
these resources constitute public goods (e.g., articles
published in journals) or because the focal organization
has established strategic alliances with other
stakeholders who privately own or control complementary
resources. Access to external resources considerably
eases the constraint imposed on organizations
by the scarcity of internal resources. Katila and
Ahuja’s (2002) conceptualization of exploration and
exploitation provides a nice example of what happens
to these concepts when the relevant resources
do not suffer from the constraint of scarcity. In keeping
with March’s (1991) arguments about the beneficial
effects of pursuing both exploration and exploitation,
Katila and Ahuja (2002) found empirical
support for their prediction that the interaction between
exploration and exploitation will have a positive
impact on new-product development. At the
same time, departing from March’s notion of exploration
and exploitation as competing phenomena, Katila
and Ahuja (2002) conceptualized these as orthogonal
variables. Exploration was operationalized as
search scope (i.e., the propensity to cite different patents),
whereas exploitation was operationalized as
2006 Gupta, Smith, and Shalley 695
search depth (i.e., the propensity to cite certain patents
repeatedly). Since the number of patents an organization
may cite is unlimited, and the marginal
cost of accessing the knowledge embedded in one
more patent is highly likely to be modest, it seems
reasonable to conclude that exploitative versus explorative
search (as reflected in patent citation data)
does not suffer from severe resource constraints.
Nerkar’s (2003) study on the antecedents of why
some patents have greater future impact than others
provides an interesting parallel to Katila and Ahuja
(2002). Nerkar looked at the main as well as the interactive
effects of exploration and exploitation in the
knowledge search underlying patents. He measured
exploration as the time spread of past knowledge and
exploitation as the recency of past knowledge, and he
left open the possibility that a specific patent might
exhibit high or low levels of both exploration and
exploitation.
Scarcity of resources as well as conflicts over
mind-sets and organizational routines are also nonissues
when a researcher’s interest lies in analyzing
exploration versus exploitation in two different domains
that are either loosely connected or connected
via standardized/modular interfaces. For
instance, consider a firm such as Cisco. The technologies
and designs embedded in Cisco’s products
suffer from a high rate of obsolescence, making it
imperative that the company pursue a highly exploratory
strategy with respect to technology and
product development. At the same time, even radically
new and different products can be manufactured,
sold, and serviced via a preexisting commercialization
infrastructure that evolves relatively
slowly (Rangan, 2005). In other words, the interfaces
between product R&D on the one hand and
manufacturing, sales, and service on the other are
relatively standardized. Note that, in this case, the
resources needed for product R&D are fundamentally
different from those needed for complementary
downstream activities. As such, it is easy to
imagine that Cisco could simultaneously engage in
a high degree of exploration in product R&D and a
high rate of exploitation in complementary domains
such as manufacturing, sales, and service.
Several recent studies have examined the idea that
organizations operate in multiple domains, not all of
which are tightly coupled via specialized interfaces.
These studies have chosen to treat exploration and
exploitation as simultaneously achievable and thus,
for all practical purposes, orthogonal. Some illustrative
examples are Baum, Li, and Usher (2000), Beckman,
Haunschild, and Phillips (2004), Koza and
Lewin (1998), and Rothaermel (2001). Baum and his
colleagues (2000) viewed an organization’s learning
from its own experience as exploitation and its learning
from others’ experience as exploration; since both
these types of learning are potentially unlimited, they
treated the two as orthogonal. Beckman and her colleagues
(2004: 259) analyzed interorganizational relationships
and treated “relationships with new partners”
as a form of exploration and “additional
relationships with existing partners” as a form of exploitation;
here too, given that the number of interfirm
relationships has no well-defined limit, the
authors treated exploration and exploitation as orthogonal.
Koza and Lewin (1998) and Rothaermel
(2001) focused on interfirm alliances and adopted a
similar logic. According to them, any firm can engage
in a multiplicity of alliances, and any one of
these alliances can be classified as exploratory or
exploitative.
Answering the question of continuity or orthogonality
may further depend on the level of analysis.
For example, with division of labor and allocation
of resources, it may be easier for a group, organization,
or larger system to simultaneously excel at
exploration and exploitation than it is for individuals
to do so. As noted, the learning, resources, and
routines necessary for exploration and exploitation
are different. As such, they may be delegated
within a group or organization so that both can be
achieved simultaneously. In this case, management
controls the allocation of decision rights to exploit
or explore. It also may be easier for a group or
organization to switch between exploration and exploitation
when appropriate change routines are in
place and management recognizes the need for
change. For example, Gilson, Mathieu, Shalley, and
Ruddy (2005) found that teams that felt empowered
by their organization to use creative problem solving
as well as standardized routines and procedures
had the highest levels of team effectiveness.
In contrast, one can imagine that it would be difficult
for an individual to develop routines to excel
simultaneously at both exploration and exploitation.
Further, given the substantial differences in
routines and focus on learning, it may be very difficult
for an individual to even switch between
routines of exploration and exploitation. Amabile
(1996) suggested that individuals who focus on creativity,
exploration, and experimentation are quite
different from those who emphasize appropriate
actions. For example, those focused on creativity
may be intrinsically motivated, whereas individuals
focused on acting appropriately, especially for
rewards, may be extrinsically motivated. Fiske and
Taylor (1991) further described how well-developed
belief systems resist change and how individuals
persevere despite information suggesting that
change is necessary, a conclusion also reached by
Audia, Locke, and Smith (2000).
696 Academy of Management Journal August
The following conclusions summarize our
arguments:
1. The scarcer the resources needed to pursue both
exploration and exploitation, the greater the likelihood
that the two will be mutually exclusive—that
is, high values of one will necessarily imply low
values of the other.
2. Within a single domain (i.e., an individual or a
subsystem), exploration and exploitation will generally
be mutually exclusive.
3. Across different and loosely coupled domains
(i.e., individuals or subsystems), exploration and
exploitation will generally be orthogonal, in that
high levels of exploration or exploitation in one
domain may coexist with high levels of exploration
or exploitation in the other domain.
As the above conclusions indicate, we do not
believe that a universal argument can be made in
favor of either continuity or orthogonality. The relationship
between exploration and exploitation
depends very much on whether the two compete
for scarce resources and whether or not the analysis
focuses on a single or on multiple domains. Accordingly,
it is important for researchers to ensure
that their chosen premise (i.e., continuity or orthogonality)
rests on a foundation of logic and theory.
It also is important to note that starting premises
regarding continuity or orthogonality will have direct
implications for how researchers test for the
performance implications of pursuing both exploration
and exploitation. If the premise is that exploration
and exploitation are two ends of a continuum
(and thus mutually exclusive), then the
correct test for the beneficial effects of balance
would be to test for an inverted U-shaped relationship
between degree of exploration (or exploitation)
and organizational performance. On the other
hand, if the premise is that exploration and exploitation
are orthogonal, then the correct test for the
beneficial effects of balance would be to test for a
positive interaction effect of the two types of learning
on organizational performance. Figure 1 depicts
these arguments in graphical form.
AMBIDEXTERITY VERSUS PUNCTUATED
EQUILIBRIUM
Arguments in favor of the need for both exploration
and exploitation are well established and accepted
(Ancona, Goodman, Lawrence, & Tushman,
2001; Benner & Tushman, 2002; Dougherty, 1992;
Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Feinberg & Gupta, 2004;
Levinthal &March, 1993; March, 1991, 1996, 2006).
As March noted, “Adaptive systems that engage in
exploration to the exclusion of exploitation are
likely to find that they suffer the costs of experimentation
without gaining many of the benefits.
They exhibit too many undeveloped new ideas and
too little distinctive competence. Conversely, systems
that engage in exploitation to the exclusion of
exploration are likely to find themselves trapped in
suboptimal stable equilibria” (1991: 71).
Although near consensus exists on the need for
balance, there is considerably less clarity on how
this balance can be achieved. As mechanisms to
help organizations realize this balance, the two primary
contenders are ambidexterity (Benner &
Tushman, 2003; Burgelman, 1991; Christensen,
1998; Levinthal, 1997; Weick, 1976) and punctuated
equilibrium (Burgelman, 2002; Levinthal &
March, 1993; Siggelkow & Levinthal, 2003; Tushman
& Romanelli, 1985; Vermeulen & Barkema,
2001). Benner and Tushman provided an excellent
articulation of the logic behind ambidexterity:
Ambidextrous organization designs are composed of
highly differentiated but weakly integrated subunits.
While the exploratory units are small and
FIGURE 1
Testing for the Performance Effects of a Balance
between Exploitation and Exploration
2006 Gupta, Smith, and Shalley 697
decentralized, with loose cultures and processes,
the exploitation units are larger and more centralized,
with tight cultures and processes. Exploratory
units succeed by experimenting—by frequently creating
small wins and losses (Sitkin, 1992). Because
process management tends to drive out experimentation,
it must be prevented from migrating into
exploratory units and processes. In contrast, exploitation
units that succeed by reducing variability and
maximizing efficiency and control are an ideal location
for the tight coordination associated with
process management efforts. (2003: 252)
As noted above, ambidexterity is not the only
possible solution to the quest for balance between
exploration and exploitation. Punctuated equilibrium,
or temporal cycling between long periods of
exploitation and short bursts of exploration, have
been identified as an alternative balancing mechanism
that may be both logical and practical. As
Levinthal and March argued, “Less prominent in
the normative literature on strategy and organizations,
but prominent in more descriptive accounts
(Cyert & March, 1992), is the sequential allocation
of attention to divergent goals. While the sequential
allocation of attention is generally viewed as an
outcome of goal conflict and bounded rationality, it
also results in a simplification of experiments in
organizational change” (2003: 98). Following similar
lines, and drawing on his detailed analysis of
Andy Grove’s 1987–98 reign as CEO of Intel Corporation,
Burgelman (2002) appeared to suggest
that punctuated equilibrium is a more viable mechanism
than ambidexterity:
Does optimal long-run adaptation follow a punctuated
equilibrium pattern (e.g., Tushman and Romanelli,
1985), perhaps involving a series of discrete
periods, each focused on maximally exploiting
the available opportunities, rather than a more continuous
evolutionary process of balancing exploitation
of available opportunities at a given time with
preparing the ground for future growth opportunities?
. . . This study’s findings raise the question of
whether induced and autonomous strategy processes
are fundamentally at odds with one another
or can be effectively pursued simultaneously. Maintaining
the simultaneity of induced (variation reducing)
and autonomous (variation increasing)
strategy processes may involve difficulties similar to
maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation
in organizational learning (March, 1991).
(Burgelman, 2002: 354)
Given that ambidexterity and punctuated equilibrium
are very different yet both logical and viable
ways to achieve balance between exploration
and exploitation, an obvious question surfaces: Are
the two mechanisms equal substitutes, or is the
appropriateness of each mechanism a function of
environmental and organizational context? In addressing
this question, we would argue that the
contingency perspective has considerable merit. If
one is analyzing exploration and exploitation
within a single domain (i.e., an individual OR a
subsystem), and exploration and exploitation are
rightly conceptualized as the mutually exclusive
ends of a continuum, ambidexterity is simply not
an option, and the individual or subsystem must
resort to punctuated equilibrium. In the language of
systems (Henderson & Clark, 1990), this would be
the case when one’s focus is on innovation in system-
level architecture. By definition, system-level
architecture encompasses an entire system and
constitutes a single domain. Thus, long-term adaptation
at the level of architecture requires sequential
attention to exploitation and exploration—that
is, punctuated equilibrium. Intel Corporation,
viewed from the perspective of its CEO, fitted this
model (Burgelman, 2002). In contrast, as argued
earlier, if one is analyzing exploration and exploitation
in multiple, loosely connected domains, the
two become orthogonal tasks, and it becomes entirely
feasible (and perhaps desirable) to pursue
ambidexterity. In the language of systems design,
exploration can be pursued in one module of a
modular system while exploitation is pursued in
another.
We can now summarize the above arguments in
the form of the following conclusions:
1. When analysis is confined to a single domain
(i.e., individual or subsystem) and exploration and
exploitation are conceptualized as two ends of a
common continuum, logic dictates that punctuated
equilibrium be viewed as the appropriate adaptation
mechanism for balancing the need for both
exploration and exploitation.
2. When analysis involves action in multiple and
loosely connected domains and exploration and
exploitation are conceptualized as orthogonal,
logic dictates that ambidexterity be viewed as the
appropriate adaptation mechanism for balancing
the need for both exploration and exploitation.
3. Ambidexterity and punctuated equilibrium may
be easier to achieve at an organizational or system
level than at an individual or subsystem level of
analysis.
These conclusions are not as disparate as they may
at first appear to be. Consider a system comprised
of two loosely coupled individuals or subsystems,
A and B. At time t1, subsystem A may be pursuing
exploration while B pursues exploitation. At time
t2, subsystem A may switch to exploitation, while B
switches to exploration. Thus, within each subsystem
(i.e., each single domain), long-run adaptation
occurs via punctuated equilibrium. However,
698 Academy of Management Journal August
across the two domains, long-run adaptation occurs
via ambidexterity. Finally, if the two subsystems
are tightly rather than loosely coupled, then longrun
adaptation even at the level of the entire system
would require punctuated equilibrium and not ambidexterity.
As Benner and Tushman (2003) noted,
ambidexterity is not a viable option for tightly coupled
systems.
DUALITY VERSUS SPECIALIZATION
The analysis we have described so far was built
on an acceptance of March’s (1991) arguments regarding
the need for every organization to pursue
both exploration and exploitation. We now examine
in more detail whether it might be logical to
predict that, under certain conditions, long-term
survival may be feasible without balance—that is,
by dedicating an organization or system solely to
exploration or solely to exploitation.
We start with the everyday observation that organizations
operate within a broader social system
and as such are interdependent with many other
organizations (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978; Thompson,
1967). Looking through this lens, it may be possible
to predict that, under certain conditions, the balance
between exploration and exploitation could
be achieved at the level of the broader social system
rather than at the level of individual organizations.
If so, then some organizations may specialize in
exploration, some others in exploitation, while the
balance between the two is achieved via a market
(or quasi-market) interface. Such a scenario is nothing
other than the logic of ambidexterity extended
and generalized from the context of single organizations
(Benner & Tushman, 2003) to the context of
the broader social system. Building on the logic of
ambidexterity, we would argue that the specialization
strategy is likely to be effective only if the
following conditions are met: (1) The two organizations
A and B, where A specializes in exploration
and B in exploitation, control mutually complementary
resources. Such complementarity would
ensure that the output of A’s exploration is not
entirely wasted and that the promising ideas can be
handed over to B for exploitation. Conversely, even
though B focuses solely on exploitation, it has a
constant supply of radically new ideas available
from A. (2) The domain in which organization A
operates is highly dynamic, whereas the domain in
which organization B operates is highly stable. This
variation in the dynamism of environments would
ensure that A faces a persistent need for exploration,
whereas B faces a persistent need for exploitation.
(3) The degree of mutual cospecialization in
the two sets of resources is low. In the presence of
low cospecialization, a market relationship between
A and B is likely to be a sufficient and stable
means of ensuring that each gets compensated adequately
for its contribution (Teece, 1992; Williamson,
1985).
The semiconductor industry, which is experiencing
ongoing disaggregation into “fabless” semiconductor
companies (which only do product R&D)
and fabrication companies (which only do contract
manufacturing), is a good example of an industry
where the above three conditions appear to be simultaneously
valid. The complementarity between
semiconductor R&D and semiconductor production
is obvious. Also, with a relatively modest degree
of coordination, most fabrication companies
can manufacture the differing and time-varying
products of fabless companies; thus, cospecialization
in the tangible resources as well as intangible
capabilities of the two sets of organizations tends to
be relatively low.1 Finally, in the semiconductor
industry, product technologies become obsolete
very rapidly; in contrast, given the extreme capital
intensity of manufacturing resources, the rate of
evolution in production technologies is much
slower. Accordingly, a high degree of ongoing exploration
is far more essential for the pure R&D
companies, whereas a high degree of ongoing exploitation
is far more essential for the pure production
companies.
It is worth noting that both March (1991) and
Benner and Tushman (2003) signaled the possibility
that, under well-specified conditions, specialization
rather than duality might be entirely viable.
As March noted, “Finding an appropriate balance
is made particularly difficult by the fact that the
same issues occur at levels of a nested system—at
the individual level, the organizational level, and
the social system level” (1991: 72). In keeping with
this observation, we have argued above that, under
certain conditions, individual organizations may
justifiably focus solely on exploration or exploitation
while delegating the task of achieving a balance
between the two to the social system. Along
1 According to field interviews with executives in two
different fabless semiconductor companies headquartered
in California, semiconductor manufacturers share
design rules and SPICE models (“SPICE” is “Simulation
Package for Integrated Circuit Emulation”) with the fabless
companies. As long as the product design of a new
chip conforms to these rules and models, the need for
coordination between a fabless company and a contract
manufacturer is relatively modest. The same facility can
manufacture multiple generations of semiconductor
chips, even when different generations have radically
different product designs.
2006 Gupta, Smith, and Shalley 699
similar lines, in concluding their arguments regarding
the desirability of ambidextrous organizations,
Benner and Tushman noted: “While our ideas may
be relevant for all types and sizes of firms, they
apply most readily to firms whose strategies include
both exploitative and exploratory innovation.
. . . Our propositions are therefore less relevant
for firms whose strategies focus solely on
either exploitation or exploratory innovation”
(2003: 252). Although Benner and Tushman (2003)
clearly accepted the possibility of specialized organizations,
they did not articulate the conditions
under which such specialization might be not only
viable but also effective for fostering long-term survival.
We have attempted to do so above.
THE WORK IN THIS
SPECIAL RESEARCH FORUM
In this section, we summarize the papers selected
for this special research forum and connect them,
where appropriate, to the four issues discussed
above. Overall, we received 83 submissions. Of
these, the authors of 15 manuscripts were asked to
revise and resubmit, and 7 manuscripts were ultimately
accepted for publication. The 7 articles in
the special forum span all levels of analysis: the
individual operating in a team or an organizational
context (Miller, Zhao, & Calantone, 2006; Taylor &
Greve, 2006), the team (Beckman, 2006; Perretti &
Negro, 2006), the single organization (Siggelkow &
Rivkin, 2006), and the interorganizational context
(Lavie & Rosenkopf, 2006; Wadhwa & Kotha, 2006).
The papers thus range from micro to macro, and we
have arranged them in the issue along this spectrum.
Table 1 summarizes the key features of each
paper. As is obvious, the papers vary in their treatment
of the various issues discussed earlier: continuity
versus orthogonality, ambidexterity versus
punctuated equilibrium, and duality versus specialization.
These variations are entirely consistent
with and reinforce the logic reflected in the above
discussion and conclusions.
Miller, Zhao, and Calantone’s article, “Adding
Interpersonal Learning and Tacit Knowledge to
March’s Exploration-Exploitation Model,” replicates
and extends March’s (1991) model simulating
learning within an organization, using an agentbased
simulation. First, these authors extend his
model by considering the role of direct interpersonal
learning, in addition to learning from an organizational
code. Second, they place individuals
in a location or space. Doing this allows them to
distinguish between distant and local search. Finally,
Miller and colleagues recognize the importance
of tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge cannot
be transmitted through an organizational code, but
only by individuals sharing their knowledge directly
with others. The first key contribution of
Miller and colleagues’ extension of March’s model
is their recognition of the value of individual learning
and how interpersonal interactions in organizations
are critical for knowledge transfer. The second
important contribution these authors make is
their offering the first simulation model distinguishing
tacit and explicit knowledge. A third contribution
is that their model captures the spatial
bias that exists in organizations, whereby individuals
tend to interact more often with proximate
others. Finally, their model is able to differentiate
between local and distant search as two distinct
aspects of learning. Miller and colleagues’ model
points to the importance of decentralized interpersonal
learning to overcoming the potential rigidity
of organizations emphasizing exploitation rather
than exploration. Therefore, Miller, Zhao, and
Calantone highlight the fact that some degree of
specialization in exploration or exploitation can
exist at different levels in a system, while the overall
system exhibits duality.
Taylor and Greve’s article,“Superman or the
Fantastic Four? Knowledge Combination and Experience
in Innovative Teams,” examines
whether the team compositional factors— diversity
of knowledge and experience working together—
that lead to variance-enhancing behaviors
(i.e., exploration) differ from those that lead
to higher mean performance (i.e., exploitation).
They examine these issues by studying teams
involved in the creation and publishing of comic
books (e.g., artists and writers). Taylor and Greve
argue and find that having multiple knowledge
domains leads to the combining of knowledge in
ways that yield innovations. Somewhat surprisingly,
they find that similar factors affect both
innovations that lead to extreme success or failure
(as measured by a comic’s commercial value)
and those that lead to high average performance.
Also, individuals were found to be able to combine
diverse knowledge more effectively than
teams, which makes sense, given the potential
process losses inherent in team work. A key contribution
of this paper is that the researchers look
at the full range of innovations, rather than only
successful innovations. Therefore, they are able to
model factors that can lead to high mean performance
over time, radical innovations, and commercial failures.
This is important, since much of the prior research
has not looked at the effect of risk and what
factors lead to failures rather than successes.

Second, Taylor and Greve’s findings point to the
value of measuring the career experiences and knowledge
of team members, since they found that the right
team composition (for instance, diverse members as
well as depth of experience) can enable an ambidextrous
approach. Third, their finding that common
factors predict both exploration and exploitation
points to the orthogonality of these approaches for
teams. Finally, they discuss how the dichotomy of
exploration versus exploitation may actually be
driven by differences in goals and expectations for a
task rather than by different team knowledge assets.
Thus, Taylor and Greve’s work highlights the learning
and knowledge exchanges between heterogeneous
team members that can enhance ambidexterity.
In her article, “The Influence of Founding Team
Company Affiliations on Firm Behavior,” Beckman
proposes that the firm and market experience of
new ventures’ founders (their prior company affiliations)
shape the type of new firms created as well
as the strategies and structures put into place. She
argues that founding teams with members with
common prior company affiliations are more likely
to have shared beliefs and a common language,
which will contribute to the adoption of routines
for efficiency and incremental improvements in
products and processes (i.e., exploitation). It
should be noted that Beckman views prior common
affiliations as important not because founding team
members have had direct prior work experience
with each other, but because cohesion results from
shared experiences gained through the mere affiliation
with the same company. On the other hand,
Beckman argues that diverse prior company affiliations
lead to a variety of perspectives, the discovery
of new alternatives, and increased external social
capital, which should lead to innovations (i.e.,
exploration). Finally, she expects founding teams
composed of a mixture of members with both common
and diverse prior company affiliations to promote
organizational ambidexterity and ultimately
greater firm performance. She finds support for
these arguments. A key contribution of this paper is
the message that new firms need to pay attention to
the composite set of experiences that potential
team members have had when constructing founding
teams. This view is a nice complement to Taylor
and Greve’s (2006) focus on the role of career
experiences and knowledge of team members.
Also, Beckman is able to show that diverse founding
teams can be ambidextrous in their use of strategies,
an ability that improves firm performance.
Perretti and Negro’s article, “Filling Empty Seats:
How Status and Organizational Hierarchies Affect
Exploration versus Exploitation in Team Design,”
focuses on the introduction of newcomers and the
formation of new member combinations in team
design. Treating exploration and exploitation as
two ends of a continuum, they take the position
that team design can be viewed as more exploratory
when the proportion of newcomers on a team is
high and/or when the proportion of new member
combinations is high. Perretti and Negro’s empirical
setting is the Hollywood film industry during
the period 1929–58, and their teams are the fiveperson
groups that contain the key players in the
development of any film: the director, the two lead
actors, the editor, and the director of photography.
They regard team members as new when they are
new to the industry as a whole. In keeping with
Phillips and Zuckerman’s (2001) notion of “middle-
status conformity,” Perretti and Negro find that
team design is most exploratory when it is driven
by either very high status or very low status individuals.
Further, building on Siggelkow and
Levinthal (2003), they also find that team design is
most exploratory within organizational contexts
with either three hierarchical layers or one layer. In
summary, both decision maker status and the extent
of organizational hierarchy have U-shaped relationships
with exploration/exploitation choices
in team design.
Siggelkow and Rivkin’s article, “When Exploration
Backfires: Unintended Consequences of Multilevel
Organizational Search,” questions the accepted
proposition that decentralization of the
exploration process by bringing it to lower organizational
levels enhances exploration and performance
for an entire organization. In an agent-based
simulation, they find that decentralization can in
fact backfire and diminish exploration as well as
performance for the organization as a whole. However,
they also find that when lower-level units are
loosely connected to one another—for example,
when the level of interdependency between departments
is low—more extensive exploration at lower
levels can increase performance for the organization.
Siggelkow and Rivkin contribute to our understanding
of how exploration can be achieved in
multilevel organizations by focusing on the question
of when exploration should be decentralized.
They conclude that decentralization is appropriate
when decisions and departments are modularized.
This paper reinforces our discussion of the appropriateness
of specialization and certain organizational
design features, such as loosely coupled
structures, for achieving exploration.
Lavie and Rosenkopf’s article, “Balancing Exploration
and Exploitation in Alliance Formation,” explains
how equilibrium between exploration and
exploitation is achieved through three forms of alliances:
function (marketing or R&D), structure (re-
702 Academy of Management Journal August
current partner or new partner), and attribute (similar
or dissimilar partner). Their focus on different
types of alliances reflects the premise that organizations
can pursue exploration and exploitation in
different domains; for example, firms can trade off
exploring in R&D functions versus exploiting in
marketing functions; learning from new partners
versus taking repeat partners; and working with
similar partners versus working with dissimilar
partners. Data from a sample of U.S. software firms
suggested that although path dependencies reinforce
existing patterns of exploration or exploitation
within certain domains, software firms do balance
alliance exploration and exploitation both
over time and across domains. Lavie and Rosenkopf’s
results emphasize the importance of looking
at different types of exploration and exploitation
through a wide lens and using longitudinal data to
study the balancing process. The firms they studied
appeared to be able to deploy both ambidextrous
strategies (exploration and exploitation at the same
time) and punctuated equilibrium strategies
(switching across time). However, if researchers
were to examine a single type of alliance over a
shorter period, specialization rather than balance
might emerge as the more valid description.
Finally, Wadhwa and Kotha’s article, “Knowledge
Creation through External Venturing: Evidence
from the Telecommunications Equipment
Manufacturing Industry,” examines the factors that
drive technological learning from corporate venture
capital (CVC) investments. These authors treat
exploration and exploitation as two ends of a continuum
and view CVC investments as more exploratory
when they lead to greater technological learning
on the part of corporate investors. Focusing on
the telecommunications equipment manufacturing
industry, Wadhwa and Kotha find that the number
of CVC investments has an inverted U-shaped relationship
with the extent of technological learning,
suggesting that greater involvement in CVC activity
comes not just with benefits but also with rapidly
rising costs. They also find that the impact of CVC
activity on technological learning is influenced
heavily by whether or not the parent corporation is
actively involved in the investee firm. Involvement
significantly boosts the extent of technological
learning. Most interestingly, when involvement is
high, the relationship between number of CVC investments
and technological learning changes direction
and, instead of an inverted U-shaped relationship,
a U-shaped relationship emerges. In
summary, according to Wadhwa and Kotha, technological
learning from CVC investments depends
far more on direct interpersonal interaction between
personnel on both sides than it does on mere
financial investment by larger corporations into
young ventures.
These seven articles significantly contribute to
knowledge of what drives variations in exploration
and exploitation, whether and how a balance between
the two may be achieved, and how variations
in exploration and exploitation impact performance.
Collectively, these papers also reinforce our
primary conclusions:
(1) Both exploration and exploitation involve
learning, albeit of different degrees and/or types.
(2) Depending on whether one’s focus is on a single
or multiple domains, exploration and exploitation
can be treated as two ends of a continuum or as
orthogonal to each other.
(3) Depending on the context, either ambidexterity
or punctuated equilibrium may serve as the more
appropriate balancing mechanism between exploration
and exploitation.
(4) When a multiplicity of subsystems interact
with each other via modular/standardized interfaces,
the task of balancing exploration and exploitation
can be delegated to the higher-level system,
and each subsystem can focus on just exploration
or just exploitation without any major threats to
long-run performance.
TOWARD FUTURE RESEARCH
Building on our review of the literature on exploration
versus exploitation and the seven works included
in this special research forum, the following
emerge as some of the more promising directions
for future research:
First, studies that examine exploration and exploitation
at a micro level are relatively scarce.
Even though our call for papers invited submissions
across the full range from the micro (i.e.,
individual) to the macro (i.e., the interorganizational)
levels, the bulk of the submissions focused on
the more macro levels of analysis. We hope that the
microlevel papers included in this research forum
(Miller, Zhao, & Calantone, and Taylor & Greve)
will add a fillip to research that addresses questions
at the micro level of analysis. For example, at
different stages of the creative or innovative process,
are different types of people or skills required
to be able to successfully explore or exploit? How
can managers learn to recognize good ideas to exploit?
What happens when others choose to exploit
the ideas of an individual or team? How does politics
come into play in groups in terms of when to
share exploratory ideas and when they may be exploited
by others?
Second, studies spanning multiple levels of analysis
are also relatively scarce. Studies that address
2006 Gupta, Smith, and Shalley 703
questions such as the following have the potential
to fill important gaps in scholars’ knowledge base:
What is the individual- and/or team-level origin of
organizational capabilities for exploration and exploitation?
What is the joint effect of intra- and
interfirm networks on exploration and exploitation?
How does exploration at one level interact
with exploitation at a lower or higher level? What
are the similarities, differences, and interactions
between an individual’s, a group’s, and an organization’s
creative capacity, diffusive capacity, absorptive
capacity, and risk-taking capacity? Also,
are there parallel processes between levels of analysis
in the manner in which individuals, groups, or
organizations explore and exploit that could shed
light on and inform how these processes should be
managed across levels of analysis?
Third, studies that examine the challenges associated
with achieving a balance between exploration
and exploitation are scarce. In this introductory
article, we highlighted ambidexterity and
punctuated equilibrium as two alternative mechanisms
for achieving such a balance. To date, very
few studies have examined the dynamics of each of
these mechanisms in isolation. Further, almost no
attempt has so far been made to compare and contrast
the feasibility and appropriateness of these
two mechanisms in different contexts.
In conclusion, we began this introductory article
by highlighting the importance of exploration and
exploitation for successful organizational adaptation,
technological innovation, organizational
learning, and even organizational survival. We
identified four key research questions related to
exploration and exploitation, including matters of
definition, continuity versus orthogonality, ambidexterity
versus punctuated equilibrium, and duality
versus specialization. As our discussion of these
issues and summarization of the seven papers suggests,
the twin concepts of exploration and exploitation
involve a number of complex processes, variables,
and contingencies. We are hopeful that this
special research forum will advance understanding
of these concepts. Such research is necessary and
important if researchers are to learn how complex
organizational systems can more effectively learn,
adapt, and survive in the long term.
