Meaning:
• The Roman god Janus had two sets of eyes—one pair focusing on what lay behind, the other on what lay ahead. 

• “Ambidexterity” can be defined as a state of being equally adapted in the use of both the left and the right hand, and also in using them at the same time.

Ambidextrous Organization 
• Many successful companies separate new exploratory units from exploitive traditional units, but still keep a tightly linked executive team to manage the organizational separation. 

• Such companies are referred to as “ambidextrous organizations”. 

• Managers in an ambidextrous organization are expected to be able to explore new opportunities while also making steady improvements to what already exists. 

• A clear vision is crucial in transforming a company into an ambidextrous organization.

Reasons to transform into an ambidextrous organization
• Big and old companies have a hard time innovating
• The companies must be aware of the situation and see the signals
• Often its risky to keep the old structure of the company and not changing current paths
• Ignoring the signals leads often to interruption

- Restructuring the organization and splitting teams and creating new teams makes it possible to react to the environmental change.
- Its important that every instance is ready and open-minded for the new
- The organization must focus on exploration and exploitation equally
