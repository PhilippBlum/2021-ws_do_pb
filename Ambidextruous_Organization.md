# Ambidextrous Organization 
• Many successful companies separate new exploratory units from exploitive traditional units, but still keep a tightly linked executive team to manage the organizational separation. 

• Such companies are referred to as “ambidextrous organizations”. 

• Managers in an ambidextrous organization are expected to be able to explore new opportunities while also making steady improvements to what already exists. 

• A clear vision is crucial in transforming a company into an ambidextrous organization.

# Reasons to transform into an ambidextrous organization
• Big and old companies have a hard time innovating
• The companies must be aware of the situation and see the signals
• Often its risky to keep the old structure of the company and not changing current paths
• Ignoring the signals leads often to interruption

- Restructuring the organization and splitting teams and creating new teams makes it possible to react to the environmental change.
- Its important that every instance is ready and open-minded for the new
- The organization must focus on exploration and exploitation equally

# Results of exploitation 
•	Organizations that engage in exploitation mine depths of their core strengths and make the most of the resources available with them. 
•	They focus on efficiency and productivity by capitalizing on their core strengths and differentiators. 
•	It results in 
1.	Avoidance of conflict 
2.	Reduction of change 
3.	Retaining and protecting identity. 

Example: Building new teams with focusing on specific skills from old ones so reusing or using the resources differently than before. 
Teams who are working together for several years have adapted the behavior, thinking and vision of the other team members. Switching up the teams and recreating on a different type of focus it could help to reactivate those resources for the better.
