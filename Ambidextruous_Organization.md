# Ambidextrous Organziation
---

Background
•Sustainable strategy
•Continues learning

---

# Meaning:
• The Roman god Janus had two sets of eyes—one pair focusing on what lay behind, the other on what lay ahead. 

• “Ambidexterity” can be defined as a state of being equally adapted in the use of both the left and the right hand, and also in using them at the same time. 


---

# Reasons to transform into an ambidextrous organization
• Big and old companies have a hard time innovating
• The companies must be aware of the situation and see the signals
• Often its risky to keep the old structure of the company and not changing current paths
• Ignoring the signals leads often to interruption

- Restructuring the organization and splitting teams and creating new teams makes it possible to react to the environmental change.
- Its important that every instance is ready and open-minded for the new
- The organization must focus on exploration and exploitation equally

---

## Why were Ambidextrous Organizations developed?

- Exploration and Exploitation were researched extensively and it was found out that these two ideas could not coexist in an organization for various reasons (competition for resources and so on...). 
- Therefore multiple frameworks were build to make that possible.
- And one of those frameworks is an ambidextrous organization.

# Exploitation and Exploration 

• Exploitation: It refers to constantly exploiting the available resources and ideas and making improvements wherever necessary. 


• Exploration: Constantly innovating and exploring new ideas and opportunities. 
Exploration includes things captured by terms such as search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation

organic structures, loosely coupled systems, path breaking, improvisation, autonomy and chaos, and emerging markets and technologies

# Results of Exploitation 
•	Organizations that engage in exploitation mine depths of their core strengths and make the most of the resources available with them. 
•	They focus on efficiency and productivity by capitalizing on their core strengths and differentiators. 
•	It results in 
1.	Avoidance of conflict 
2.	Reduction of change 
3.	Retaining and protecting identity. 

Example: Building new teams with focusing on specific skills from old ones so reusing or using the resources differently than before. 
Teams who are working together for several years have adapted the behavior, thinking and vision of the other team members. Switching up the teams and recreating on a different type of focus it could help to reactivate those resources for the better.

---

# Results of Exploration 
•	Organizations that focus on exploration fix their gaze upon the horizon. 
•	They discover new resources and find new ways to do things. 
•	Here the focus in on Innovation. 
•	It results in 

1.	Discovering new products, markets 
2.	Embracing conflicts and using it positively 
3.	Accepting and adapting to change 
4.	Considering new identities 

Example: Big companies build a team or new instance which is focusing on the exploration part. For example, like the bmw startup garage

## Summary
To quickly sum up, what our research found out.
1. The essence of exploitation is the refinement and extension of existing competencies, technologies, and paradigms.
2. Exploration tries to  shift to a new technology which means finding a new trajectory. They do that by planned experimentation and play.
3. The essence of exploration is experimentation with new alternatives to come up with new ideas.

## Innovation
To be sustainably successful in the long run, companies have to maintain a variety of innovation efforts. Companies must constantly pursue innovation, but at the same time they have to make architectural innovations and radical innovations. Ergo, the company must have an ambidextrous organization for them to be able to fulfill all of this. an ambidextrous organization is capable of simultaneously exploiting existing competencies and exploring new opportunities. There are two ways of organizational ambidexterity can be used; Structural ambidexterity which means that exploration and exploitation are undertaken in separate organizational units or Contextual ambidexterity which involves the same organizational units and the same organizational members pursuing both exploratory and exploitative activities .

# Ambidextrous Organizations
Ambidextrous organization designs are composed of highly differentiated but weakly integrated subunits. While the exploratory units are small and decentralized, with loose cultures and processes the exploitation units are larger and more centralized, with tight cultures and processes. Exploratory units succeed by experimenting by frequently creating small wins and losses, Because process management tends to drive out experimentation, it must be prevented from migrating into exploratory units and processes In contrast, exploitation units that succeed by reducing variability and maximizing efficiency and control are an ideal location for tight coordination associated with process management efforts.

---

# What is Ambidexterity
Ambidexterity refers to the synchronous pursuit of both exploration and exploitation via loosely coupled and differentiated subunits or individuals, each of which specializes in either exploration or exploitation.

Story of a Someone who founded a company and he had a hard time during corona. 
He read a paper on ambidextrous organization which says: "Ambidextrous organizations are able to manage organizational paradoxes and simultaneously achieve aims which seem divergent or even  contradictory such as e.g.: short-term survival and long-term growth, incremental and radical innovations or competition vs cooperation etc. Ambidexterity is achieved by balancing exploration (search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery or innovation) with exploitation (refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, and execution)". And now he thinks to himself. Ok to try to stay relevant, I have to innovate constantly and not end up like kodak. To do that, he establishes two different units in his company. One who is exploring and one who is exploiting. One who is responsible for short-term survival and the other one for long term growth.
The exploitation unit responsible for short term survival begins their work. They analyse their own company and come up with a plan to cut costs and plan out their current product portfolio. What products don't sell and which do? The ones that don't sell are thrown out of their portfolio. After a few months their revenue stayed the same but they reduced their operating cost by 50%, short term survival was guaranteed. Meanwhile the exploration unit was busy inventing new products and luckily they found a way to clone people. Now long-term growth can be guaranteed.
After only a few months someone was able to completely restructure the company by using the ambidextrous organization approach.

Brain picture On this picture you can see the upsides of both exploration and exploitation approaches. ask everyone which sides represents which concept.

# Main takeaways,

1. To stay relevant you have to constantly innovate. 
2. Approaches to that are exploration and exploitation. 
3. The framework that makes both of those concepts possible is ambidextrous organization.
4. Ambidextrous organization is a way to capture the challenge inherent in businesses being able to make steady improvements to existing models whilst still developing breakthrough innovations
