# Meaning
* The Roman god Janus had two sets of eyes—one pair focusing on what lay behind, the other on what lay ahead.

* &#34;Ambidexterity&#34; can be defined as a state of being equally adapted in the use of both the left and the right hand, and also in using them at the same time. 

---


# Reasons to transform 
* Communication problems
* poor flexibility
* long decision-making path
* Companies have a hard time innovating
* Ignoring change leads often to interruption

---

- Restructuring the organization and splitting teams and creating new teams makes it possible to react to the environmental change.
- Its important that every instance is ready and open-minded for the new
- The organization must focus on exploration and exploitation equally

---

# Why were Ambidextrous Organizations developed?

- Exploration and Exploitation were researched extensively and it was found out that these two ideas could not coexist in an organization for various reasons (competition for resources and so on...). 
- Therefore multiple frameworks were build to make that possible.
>> &rarr; one of those frameworks is an "Ambidextrous Organization"

## Exploitation and Exploration 

#### Exploitation: 
It refers to constantly exploiting the available resources and ideas and making improvements wherever necessary. 

>> &rarr; Ressources, process, units, structure, teams, etc.

#### Exploration: 
Constantly innovating and exploring new ideas and opportunities. 


 >> &rarr; Innovations, optimization, improvements through change management

# Results of exploitation 
* Organizations that engage in exploitation mine depths of their core strengths and make the most of the resources available with them. 
* They focus on efficiency and productivity by capitalizing on their core strengths and differentiators. 

It results in: 
1.	Avoidance of conflict 
2.	Reduction of change 
3.	Retaining and protecting identity. 

##### Example: 
Building new teams with focusing on specific skills from old ones so reusing or using the resources differently than before. 
Teams who are working together for several years have adapted the behavior, thinking and vision of the other team members. Switching up the teams and recreating on a different type of focus it could help to reactivate those resources for the better.

# Results of exploration 
* Organizations that focus on exploration fix their gaze upon the horizon. 
* They discover new resources and find new ways to do things. 
* Here the focus in on Innovation. 

It results in:

1.	Discovering new products, markets 
2.	Embracing conflicts and using it positively 
3.	Accepting and adapting to change 
4.	Considering new identities 

##### Example:
Big companies build a team or new instance which is focusing on the exploration part. For example, like the bmw startup garage

## Summary
To quickly sum up, what our research found out.
1. The essence of exploitation is the refinement and extension of existing competencies, technologies, and paradigms.
2. Exploration tries to  shift to a new technology which means finding a new trajectory. They do that by planned experimentation and play.
3. The essence of exploration is experimentation with new alternatives to come up with new ideas.

## Why were Ambidextrous Organizations developed?

- Exploration and Exploitation 
- Innovation
- success

# Ambidextrous Organizations

Be efficient in todays management and also be able to adapt tomorrows changes. //Link einbinden!!!

1. centralized vs decentralized
2. tight, strict culture vs loose culture
3. Maximize efficiency vs frequent experiments

Brain picture On this picture you can see the upsides of both exploration and exploitation approaches. ask everyone which sides represents which concept.

# Main takeaways

1. To stay relevant you have to constantly innovate. 
2. Approaches to that are exploration and exploitation. 
3. The framework that makes both of those concepts possible is ambidextrous organization.
4. Ambidextrous organization is a way to capture the challenge in businesses being able to make steady improvements to existing models whilst still developing breakthrough innovations.
